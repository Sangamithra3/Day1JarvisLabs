Hi! I'm **Sangamithra S**. Today marked the beginning of an exhilarating chapter in my career as I joined JarvisLabs as an intern. The day was filled with excitement, learning, and a warm welcome from a team that is as passionate about AI as I am.

## First Encounter with ComfyUI

A significant highlight of my inaugural day was diving into ComfyUI, a node-based graphical user interface for Stable Diffusion.

## Structured Learning Path

We started by exploring the JarvisLabs website to get an overview of the company and its projects. This was followed by an introduction to ComfyUI, a powerful tool designed to streamline AI model interactions.

## Hands-On Training

The team conducted a hands-on session to teach us how to use ComfyUI. This practical approach helped me quickly grasp the interface’s features and functionalities, making the learning process engaging and effective.

## Engaging Learning Experience

To deepen our understanding, we were encouraged to watch YouTube tutorials on ComfyUI, created by Vishnu, the founder of JarvisLabs. The tutorials covered several key topics:

- Basics
- SDXL Refiner
- ControlNet
- Stable Cascade
- IP-Adapter

These videos were instrumental in enhancing my knowledge and confidence in using ComfyUI.

## Reflecting on the Day

Reflecting on my first day, I am filled with excitement and optimism. The journey ahead at JarvisLabs promises opportunities for continuous learning and innovation. I am eager to contribute to the team’s cutting-edge projects and help drive the future of AI technology.
